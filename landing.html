    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        The CDC-APHL Influenza Virologic Surveillance Right Size Roadmap defines the rationale, vital capabilities and optimal "right size" for influenza virologic surveillance. The Roadmap consolidates requirements for all components of virologic surveillance in one document and provides tools to assess and improve the precision of the system to support disease surveillance, response and control efforts and policy decisions. 
    </p>

    <p>
        State and local influenza surveillance system partners are encouraged to implement a statistical, systematic approach to estimate the number of specimens to be tested in order to provide a specific level of data confidence for situational awareness, novel event detection and novel event investigation at the recommended thresholds.  Specimen sampling approaches should be established to enhance detection of novel events based on national thresholds, while at the same time collecting a representative sample of routine influenza cases for overall situational awareness at the state level.
    </p>

    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>

    <p>
        The primary audiences for the Roadmap and the sample size calculators are the state and local epidemiologists, influenza surveillance coordinators, PHL directors and other senior infectious disease laboratory staff responsible for coordinating policy, decisions, and implementation of virologic surveillance strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>Intended Use</h2>

    <p>
        The sample size calculators provided here can be used to estimate the desired number of specimens that should be tested to ensure adequate confidence in influenza surveillance data and detection of novel viruses at a point where intervention can be effective.  Alternately, these calculators can be used to demonstrate the level of confidence in the data obtained with the systems that a jurisdiction is capable of implementing.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three calculators:

    <p>
        The number of samples to be tested will vary depending on the confidence level, margin of error, threshold, and assumptions used in the calculators.  Selecting a lower confidence level increases the amount of uncertainty in the calculated prevalence but permits a smaller sample size which may be necessary if resources are limited. A higher margin of error means that more error can be tolerated.  Recommended thresholds and confidence levels are provided in the Roadmap.  Each state will need to determine how to achieve the Roadmap surveillance goals to meet both national and state needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an alternative to the on-line calculators, pre-calculated sample sizes for each of the objectives using the recommended confidence levels are provided in the Roadmap. Depending on the surveillance priorities and capacity of the system overall, jurisdictions may use the on-line calculators to vary the inputs to see how sample size is impacted.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of influenza season, achieving statistical confidence may not be possible; therefore  surveillance should shift to obtaining all specimens from participating clinical sites that have tested positive for influenza or from patients with unusual respiratory illness or travel history or risk of exposure to animal-origin viruses, along with a subset MA-ILI specimens from routine surveillance providers.
